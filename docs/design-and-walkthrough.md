|----------|-----------|
| Use ADK for agent framework | ADK provides a solid foundation for building agents, including tools for memory, state management, and more. |
| Use Gemini for LLM | Gemini is a powerful LLM that is well-suited for this application. |
| Use FastAPI for backend | FastAPI is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use web framework for building APIs. |
| Use React for frontend | React is a popular and powerful library for building user interfaces. |
| Use Terraform for infrastructure | Terraform is a tool for defining and provisioning infrastructure as code. |
| Use Google Cloud Build for CI/CD | Google Cloud Build is a managed CI/CD service that is well-suited for this application. |
| The frontend, API and backend agent will be containerised into a single container image. | This is to simplify deployment and management. |
| The container will be deployed to Cloud Run. | Cloud Run is a fully-managed, serverless compute platform that lets you run containers directly on Google Cloud infrastructure. |
