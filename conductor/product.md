# Product Definition

# Initial Concept
It is mainly to showcase what I do and what I've done. I have material in many places and it's hard to keep track. I want to consolidate this showcase. It will also be used to share what I do with development communities. And if I'm ever looking for a new job, it will be useful then also.
