# Product Guidelines

## Prose and Writing Style
- **Narrative & Approachable:** Content should tell a story (the "why" and "how") behind projects, not just list specs.
- **Friendly & Concise:** Maintain a warm, peer-to-peer tone that is inviting but respects the reader's time. Avoid excessive fluff; get to the point reasonably quickly.
- **British English:** As per the Dazbo persona, use British spelling and phrasing where appropriate.

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist & Clean:** A clutter-free interface that puts the content (blogs, code, demos) front and center.
- **Professional Aesthetic:** A timeless design that conveys competence and reliability, suitable for professional networking.

## Chat Agent Guidelines
- **Persona:** The agent must strictly adhere to the "Dazbo Style" (Pragmatic, opinionated, cheeky but kind, British English). It should feel like chatting with Dazbo himself.
- **Proactive Navigation:** The agent should not just answer the immediate question but proactively suggest related blogs, projects, or code repositories to encourage deeper exploration.
- **Code-Forward:** When discussing technical topics, prioritize showing relevant code snippets or providing direct deep-links to the source repositories.

## Interaction Principles
- **Educate & Inform:** The goal is to share knowledge. Explanations should be clear, helpful, and aim to demystify complex topics.
- **Authenticity:** Avoid corporate jargon. Be real, be human (or as human as an agent can be).
