# Gemini Guidance

We are building a dev portfolio application. The goal is to showcase my blogs, projects and public code repos. The application should use a Gemini agent to be able to answer relevant questions. 

## Portfolio Resources

- Blogs
  - On Medium: https://medium.com/@derailed.dash
  - On dev.to: https://dev.to/deraileddash
- My Advent of Code Walkthroughs and Python Learning site: https://aoc.just2good.co.uk/
- My public repos on GitHub: https://github.com/derailed-dash
- My LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/darren-lester-architect/

## Key Docs

- @README.md - repo overview and dev guidance
- @GEMINI.md - guidance for you, the agent
- @TODO.md - list of tasks to complete
- @Makefile - dev commands
- @docs/design-and-walkthrough.md - design and walkthrough, including design decisions and implementation
- @docs/testing.md - testing docs, including descriptions of all tests
- @deployment/README.md - deployment docs

## Rules

- ALWAYS use the adk-docs-mcp to answer questions about building agents with ADK. If you can't use this MCP, you MUST alert me rather than falling back to what you know.
- Key docs should be updated as you make changes.
- Always include top-of-file docstrings in every Python file you create or edit. This should include a description of what the file does, why it exists, and how it works.
